# StackOverflow Copilot

Like GitHub Copilot, but worse! Imports the first codeblock of the first answer to a StackOverflow question as an ES Module

## Usage

1. Don't
2. Install `stackoverflow-copilot`
3. Import something: `import helloWorld from "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45817227/how-to-export-function-with-webpack"`
4. Run your application: `node --experimental-loader stackoverflow-copilot index.mjs`
